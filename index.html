            <div class="explanation">
                <p>
                    Long before the first stone cities rose and empires etched their names in history, humanity
                    discovered a quiet alchemy — the fermentation of grains into a golden elixir. In clay pots buried in
                    the earth, early civilizations found not only sustenance but celebration, culture, and craft. Beer
                    was born from the land, transformed by time, and passed down by hands that understood the magic of
                    patience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Across Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Europe, this sacred brew evolved — refined by monks in abbeys and
                    experimented upon in bustling market towns. Each era added its signature, each region a flavor, each
                    brewer a story. What began as a humble act of preservation became an enduring tradition of joy and
                    gathering.
                </p>
                <p>
                    At <b>FRULI</b>, we are heirs to that tradition. We honor the ancient roots of beer-making while
                    forging our own path — blending the time-honored art of fermentation with bold, fruit-forward
                    innovation. Our brews are more than beverages; they are a bridge between the past and present,
                    crafted for those who savor authenticity and flavor in equal measure. This is the journey of beer.
                    This is the spirit of <b>FRULI</b>.
